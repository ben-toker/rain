Rain is a basic script designed to play sound effects from youtube using the command line.

# Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. (Optional) Make an alias for rain.py (*I have this as "rain" so I can query for background music or sounds from anywhere*)
3. Fill "APIKEY.txt" with your Youtube Data API v3 key.
4. Enjoy :D

```python3 rain.py #this will play rain sounds from youtube ```
```python3 rain.py thunder #this will pay thunder sounds, etc.```
